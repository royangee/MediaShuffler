# MediaShuffler
Adds a random numbered tag to files in a specific location.

This tool was created because my bluetooth car transmitter doesn't have a shuffle mode to play songs. Once in a while, I shuffle the files in the micro SD card and put it back in the transmitter.

TO USE:
1. Open MediaShuffler.exe
2. When prompted, enter the path of your files.
3. Chose your action in the selected menu (generate tags, remove tags or both)
4. Wait for the tool to finish tagging your files.

Note: The MediaShuffler will target specific files extensions to avoid system file issues.
To modify the extensions configuration of the you'd like to tag go to: config/configurations.txt
Then add/remove your file extension in 'mediaTypes'.
